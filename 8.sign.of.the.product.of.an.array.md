# 💙 8 - Solution [1882]. Sign of the Product of an Array

###  Python Used Concepts
- .pop() method
- for loop

### 📝 Quick explanation
- Define `product` by popping the 1° element in the given array.
- Iterate over each num in nums array and redefine product with `product = product * n`, which will give us the product of all the array numbers.
- Declare a series of **if´s** with the return cases.

# 💙 Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def arraySign(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        product = nums.pop(0)
        for n in nums:
            product *= n
        if product > 0:
            return 1
        elif product < 0:
            return -1
        else:
            return 0
