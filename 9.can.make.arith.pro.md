
# 💙 9 - Solution [1502]. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence

###  Python Used Concepts
- *.sort()* built int method
- *for loop*

### 📝 Quick explanation
1. If the given array has only 2 values, return True, because it can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression.
2. To check if the list can be an arithmetic progression we need to  sort the list in ascending order with `arr.sort()`: 
`[3, 5, 1] -> [1, 3, 5]`
3. to verify that the list is suitable for an arithmetic progression, we set up a `for loop` to verify that the list is suitable for an arithmetic progression. 
The loop iterates through the length of the array minus 2.
Inside the loop, we establish an `if` statement that in case the subtraction `(i) - (i+1)` gives a result different from `(i+1) - (i+2)` Return False because the array would not be suitable for an arithmetic progression.
If this doesn't happen it would mean that the array could be rearranged to be an arithmetic progression

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canMakeArithmeticProgression(self, arr):
        """
        :type arr: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if len(arr) == 2:
            return True 
        
        arr.sort()
        
        for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
            if not (arr[i] - arr[i+1]) == (arr[i+1]- arr[i+2]):
                return False
        else:
            return True
