# 💙 11 - Solution [13]. Roman to Integer

## ⚙️ Problem Approach 
- Declare a 'dict' containing the Roman numerals and their integer values.
- We declare 're' which will be the final result that we will return.
- We iterate from left to right with a for loop.
    In the case that the numerical value of `i[s]` is less than the value `i+1[s]` means that `i[s]` is subtracted from the next value (i+1[s]), so we declare `re -= rom[s[i]]`.
- If this condition is not met, we sum `rom[s[i]]` to the final result


## 📝 Code Explanation
1. Python dict containing roman numerals and their respect integer numbers
2. We declare `re = 0` which will contain the final result.
3. Declare a for loop iterating the length of the given string (`s`).
4. We declare an if with 2 conditions, the 1st is to check that there isanother character in the given string. The 2nd condition checks if the current numeral is smaller than the one following it.
If true, it means the current numeral is part of a subtractive notation (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9). So we update the final result with `re -= rom[s[i]]`.
5. If this conditions not met, we update de final result by adding the currrent value to the final return variable (`re += rom[s[i]]`)


# 💙 Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def romanToInt(self, s):
        rom = {'I':1, 'V':5, 'X':10, 'L':50,'C':100, 'D':500, 'M':1000}
        re = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i + 1 < len(s) and rom[s[i]] < rom[s[i + 1]]:
                re -= rom[s[i]]
            else:
                re += rom[s[i]]
        return re
