# 💙 14 - Solution [682]. Baseball Game

## ⚙️ Problem Approach / Explanation
We need to keep the score from a given score and return the sum of all scores on the record after applying all the operations.

## 📝 Quick Code Explanation
- Create a new 'score' list which will contain the results of all operations and then will be summed and returned.
- Define a `for loop` which will iterate over the given score list and detect which operation should be done and append the result to the 'score' list.
    - if i == '+': append  the sum of the previpus two scores.
    - elif i == 'D': Append the double of the last score.
    - elif i == 'C': Remove the last record.
    - else: Append i to the score list.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def calPoints(self, operations):
        score = []
        
        for i in operations:
            if i == '+':
                score.append(score[-1] + score[-2])
            elif i == 'D':
                score.append(2 * score[-1])
            elif i == 'C':
                score.pop()
            else:
                score.append(int(i))
        
        return sum(score)
