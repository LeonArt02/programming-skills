# ðŸ’™ Solution 389.Find the Difference
## Using Python frequency dictionary 

- Starts by counting the frequency of the characters in the string and creating a Dictionary with the value and the frequency for each string (s & t)
- Then we itarate over t frequency Dictionary and set 2 conditionals
- If 'c' (wich is the value in the 't' string) is not in freq_s (Wich is the original string) retrun 'c' wich will be the added letter.
- If the added letter is repeated in the string then we count the frequency of the letter in both string, if the freq is larger in the new string, then 'c' is the added letter weÂ´re looking for.

        :type s: str

        # Counter() counts the frequency of the values in a given arg
        # and returns a Dict with the values
        freq_s = Counter(s)
        freq_t = Counter(t)
        
        # Iterate over the dictionary wich has the frequency of the values
        for c in freq_t:
            # If c is not in the original string return c
            if c not in freq_s:
                return c
            # In case that the added value is a repeated one:
            if freq_s[c] < freq_t[c]:
                return c
